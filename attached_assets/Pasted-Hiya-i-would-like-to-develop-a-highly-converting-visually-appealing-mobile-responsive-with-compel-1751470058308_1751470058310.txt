Hiya, i would like to develop a highly-converting, visually appealing, mobile responsive with compelling, purposeful contents that would immediately help students build trust on the brand for study abroad advisory services business Linkuble, a part of the Lurnable Education Group, UK. 

I want you to please research competitor websites:

www.go.study - for the design, content and clean layout - inspiration
https://yocket.com/premium/ - for the pricing tiers

Based on the inspirations from these websites - i want you to help me create a no-fluff, clean advisory services website with some ai or  non-ai tool perhaps a country selector or do share your ideas on what could be done?

Business model - free PG services as a typical study abroad agency but offering premium services for students targeting elite universities/top-ranking universities across the world, UG advisory services will be paid for services only - 

use this as a reference:

PG Premium	PG applicants applying to 2+ countries or needing edits	Multi-country planning, deeper SOP/LOR edits, more personalised guidance	£599
PG Elite	Oxbridge, Ivy League, NUS/NTU, top-tier applicants	Strategic mentorship, full profiling, unlimited edits, application management, mock interviews	£2,000
UG Premium	UG applicants to competitive unis (non-Oxbridge/Ivy)	Course guidance, 6–8 applications, 2 rounds of SOP/LOR edits, visa prep, 1 mock interview	£499
UG Elite	Ambitious UG students targeting Oxbridge/Ivies	Full profile building, 10–12 applications, unlimited editing, parental updates, 2–3 mock interviews	£2,000 

but do come up with better pricing structure and offering by refering to other websites offering similar services including Yocket's premium services listed in the above mentioned website;

do not be explicit about the pricing in the home page instead focus on benefits of studying abroad, why linkuble, our process, our expertise, you can also pick up and list the videos of testimonials from this list:

your role is not just to understand the depth of the business but to bring them into idea, a visually compelling website that students would love to latch on to; this website must possess contents that is highly converting and purposeful/useful for them;

do feel free to include a list of countries like the UK, USA, Canada, AUstralia, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Finland, Netherlands, Russia, Georgia, Singapore, UAE etc and write a short content highlighting brief about study abroad benefits in each one of these countries like this: Why study in the UK?
